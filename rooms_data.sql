-- Explanation of the Data:

    -- Room 101: A standard category room, priced at $150.00, located on the 1st floor, clean, and facing North.
    -- Room 102: A deluxe category room, priced at $200.00, located on the 1st floor, not clean, and facing East.
    -- Room 203: Another standard category room, priced at $155.00, located on the 2nd floor, clean, and facing South.
    -- Room 204: A suite category room, priced at $300.00, located on the 2nd floor, clean, and facing West.
    -- Room 305: A deluxe category room, priced at $220.00, located on the 3rd floor, not clean, and facing North.
    -- Room 306: A standard category room, priced at $160.00, located on the 3rd floor, clean, and facing East.

-- Additional Considerations:

    -- Auto-Increment id: The id column is set to AUTO_INCREMENT, so itâ€™s not included in the INSERT statements since it will be automatically populated by the database.
    -- Facing Direction: The facing column uses TINYINT values to represent directions (1 = North, 2 = East, 3 = South, 4 = West).
    -- Clean Status: The clean column is a boolean, indicating whether the room is clean (true) or not (false).
